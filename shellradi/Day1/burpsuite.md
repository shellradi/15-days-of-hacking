Learning the basics and major components of Burp Suite, the de facto tool to use when performing web app testing.

<body> <p>  

Burp Suite, a framework of web application pentesting tools, is widely regarded as the de facto tool to use when performing web app testing.
By default burp-suite community is installed in kali


### Read the overview and continue on into installation!

 ## Task 2 Installation 
 
 
We'll use the Burp Suite Community Edition throughout this lab, however, I'll be covering some paid features briefly as well to help you prepare for eventually using the Professional version.

### If you'll be installing Burp (as it's commonly referred to) from scratch, you'll need to first visit this link: https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload
 <i> ans: no answer needed </i>
 
 ### Once you've reached the Port Swigger downloads page, go ahead and download the appropriate version for your operating system
 <i> ans: no answer needed </i>
 
 ### Burp Suite requires Java JRE in order to run. Download and install Java here: https://www.java.com/en/download/
Once you've got everything setup move onto our next task, Gettin' [CA] Certified!

## Task 3 Gettin' [CA] Certified 
 
 

Before we can start using our new installation (or preinstalled) Burp Suite, we'll have to fix a certificate warning. We need to install a CA certificate as BurpSuite acts as a proxy between your browser and sending it through the internet - It allows the BurpSuite Application to read and send on HTTPS data. 

A certificate warning that will appear unless we install Burp's CA Certificate.

One quick note, in this lab I'll be using Firefox and Foxy Proxy. I use Firefox in this instance as it's a little bit easier to work with when using Burp Suite. 

 First, let's go ahead and launch Burp.
 click on 'Applications' and type in Burp Suite. Click on the Burp Suite icon that appears.
 
 ### launch burp
  <i> ans: no answer needed </i>

 

Once you've launched Burp, you'll be greeted with the following screen:
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41240719/152121624-3e3c81d2-4a3e-46f4-877a-5dc9c2cd9640.png)

### Once this pops-up, click 'Temporary project' and then 'Next'.

*Now as you likely noticed both 'New project on disk' and 'Open existing project' are both grayed out. As annotated at the top of this window saving projects is a feature associated with Burp Suite Professional as it's pretty common to save and come back to a multi-day web application test. 
  <i> ans: no answer needed </i>
 
 Next, we'll be prompted to ask for what configuration we'd like to use. For now, select 'Use Burp defaults'.

### This option is included as it can be incredibly useful to create a custom configuration file for your proxy or other settings, especially depending on how your network configuration and/or if Burp Suite is being launched remotely 
   <i> ans: no answer needed </i>
 
 ### Finally, let's go ahead and Start Burp! Click 'Start Burp' now!
   <i> ans: no answer needed </i>

 You'll now see a screen that looks similar to this:

 Since we now have Burp Suite running, the proxy service will have started by default with it. In order to fully leverage this proxy, we'll have to install the CA certificate included with Burp Suite (otherwise we won't be able to load anything with SSL). To do this, let's launch Firefox now!

 ###  *You can do this part with your browser of choice, however, I'll be using Firefox
  <i> ans: no answer needed </i>
 
 

Now that we've started Burp, let's add an extension to our web browser to allow up to easily route or traffic through it! For this room, we'll be using 'FoxyProxy Standard' on Firefox.

 ## Task 4 Overview of Features 
 
 Now that we've set up Burp, let's take a look at everything it has to offer. Web application pentesting can be a messy affair but Burp has something for every step of the way. 
 
 components of Burp Suite
 
 Proxy - What allows us to funnel traffic through Burp Suite for further analysis
Target - How we set the scope of our project. We can also use this to effectively create a site map of the application we are testing.
Intruder - Incredibly powerful tool for everything from field fuzzing to credential stuffing and more
Repeater - Allows us to 'repeat' requests that have previously been made with or without modification. Often used in a precursor step to fuzzing with the aforementioned Intruder
Sequencer - Analyzes the 'randomness' present in parts of the web app which are intended to be unpredictable. This is commonly used for testing session cookies
Decoder - As the name suggests, Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding.
Comparer - Comparer as you might have guessed is a tool we can use to compare different responses or other pieces of data such as site maps or proxy histories (awesome for access control issue testing). This is very similar to the Linux tool diff.
Extender - Similar to adding mods to a game like Minecraft, Extender allows us to add components such as tool integrations, additional scan definitions, and more!
Scanner - Automated web vulnerability scanner that can highlight areas of the application for further manual investigation or possible exploitation with another section of Burp. This feature, while not in the community edition of Burp Suite, is still a key facet of performing a web application test
